# PL-Heuristic

This repository exposes three executable packages: one for the
heuristic, the integer linear model, and the validator respectively.
The heuristic quickly solves a problem using a sub-optimal method
(seconds). The ILP takes considerably longer (days), but does guarantee
optimality. The validator is a tool that confirms a given solution
satisfies the imposed constraints.
